Pre-study week
==============

During the pre-study week you should acquire basics in at least one interpreted
language in case you have never used one (we recommend Python) and basics in at
least one compiled language in case you have never used one (we recommend C or
C++ or Fortran).

The reason for this is that we will not teach programming languages but we will
teach tools and work-flows for an efficient collaborative programming. We
believe that developers who use compiled languages can benefit from interpreted
languages and vice versa.

But if you prefer Ruby to Python then there is nothing wrong with that.

We also recommend to study the basics of version control using Git. This will
be treated during the lectures as well but it will help to already have a basic
idea.

We ask you to prepare a short description (less than one page) of your project
and of the development, testing, documentation, and collaboration environment
and workflow (if any).  It is a useful exercise to bring this to paper. This
will also be useful as documentation for other people who wish to join your
project.
